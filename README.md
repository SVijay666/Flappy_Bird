# Flappy_Bird
- A simple game of flappy bird made using the Pygame library where you have to control the bird and try to prevent colliding from the incoming pipes. The game is responsive as it takes inputs from the user for determining the vertical position of the bird on the screen using the event module of the Pygame library. The generation of pipes and their heights is done at random using the random module. The space between a pair of upper and lower pipes is maintained using 2D coordinate geometry to always be greater than a certain offset value. The game also incorporates the sound effects as a result of certain activities. A live score is produced at the end of each run. The game blits a set of images using the inbuilt convert_alpha() method of the Pygame library at 32 FPS.

- Instructions:
  Just install the Pygame package and run the main file using the python interpreter. Press the 'space bar' to start and the game and also to control the bird. Use 'escape' key to exit.
